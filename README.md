# **Amazon Web Scraping Project**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on automating the extraction of product details from Amazon using Python. It showcases web scraping techniques to retrieve and analyze data such as product names, prices. The extracted data can be used for price comparisons, product trend analysis, or building datasets for further exploration.

## **Features**
- Connects to Amazon's product pages using a URL and simulates a browser through custom HTTP headers.
- Extracts key product details, including:
  - Product title
  - Price
- Handles dynamic content and adapts to different page structures.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `BeautifulSoup`: For parsing and navigating HTML documents.
  - `requests`: To make HTTP requests and fetch web page content.
  - `time`: To manage delays for ethical scraping practices.
  - `datetime`: For time-stamping scraped data.

## **How It Works**
1. The script uses the `requests` library to send an HTTP GET request to an Amazon product page.
2. It parses the HTML response with `BeautifulSoup` to locate and extract relevant product information.
3. The extracted data is formatted for easy analysis and display.

## **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.6 or higher.
- Install the required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install requests beautifulsoup4
  ```

## **Setup Instructions**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnuThatikonda/Amazon-WebScraping.git
   cd Amazon-WebScraping
   ```
2. Update the `URL` variable in the script with your target Amazon product URL. Example:
   ```python
   URL = 'https://www.amazon.com/dp/example-product'
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python amazon_scraper.py
   ```

## **Best Practices for Web Scraping**

- **Use Headers**: Mimic a real browser by including headers in your requests.
- **Add Delays**: Use `time.sleep()` between requests to avoid overloading servers.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Store the scraped data in a database (e.g., MySql) for better management and querying.
- Visualize trends and insights from the scraped data using tools like Tableau or Matplotlib.
- Automate scraping across multiple product categories.
